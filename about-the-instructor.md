# About the Instructor

I'm Kas. I live in Austin, Texas, with 2 cats and a roommate who is most likely human. 

During the day, I work as a Developer Relations Engineer for a company called IOpipe.

I have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, which is the most expensive useless piece of paper I've ever worked for.

I'm working on a Bachelor's of Science and Engineering in Electrical Engineering because I want to have another expensive but less useless piece of paper.

I love NodeBots, both the subject and the community, and I spend my free \(ha\) time trying to make this community accessible to all who wish to join.
